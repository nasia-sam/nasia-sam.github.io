      <h2> Early life </h2>
      <p> I was born and raised in the west suburb of Thessaloniki, Evosmos. My favourite subject in school was Maths and Art. Actually, when I was younger
        I wanted to be an artist cause I really liked painting, but my brother told me that most of the artists are recognised after their death and that
        they don't have money and I was five years old then, and I got scared and quite drawing.</p>
      <p>Later, I wanted to be a criminologist or a homocide detective (I was watching too much NCIS and Criminal Minds) but my brother crushed my dreams <i>again</i>
      this time by telling me that it won't be like the television and I will be very bored doing that cause I won't have any interesting cases in Greece. So, I started my senior
      year in high school whithout hopes or dreams. Araound February, my programming techer encouraged my to pursue a career in software engineering
      and "become a female Bill Gates" (yeah, I wish!) so here am I, taking the html class in my 5th year! </p>
      <p>When I was in my first semester I really believed that I will finish the college in four years. I had the 3rd hishest grade from high school in my year and passed
      all of my classes with the first try. Later, i kinda lost that enthousiasm in later semesters but here I am, trying to understand what I want from my life! </p>
      <p>It's really hard for my to write 5 pages about me, I don't have much to say. Also, if you are reading this, I'm sorry -i really thought that nobody wouldn't. Don't
      waste your energy here. Go to the music & books page, I actually put love in that one so go read this instead! I'm just writing things in order to fill the page. But I can't write Lorem ipsum things,
      so here am I, writitng things that no one cares about. But now I have a whole new paragraph so goal succeeded. And it actually looks good. Also, excuse my grammatical or syntax mistakes
      -as I said I don't expect anyone to read this. Now, stop reading this and just go listen to my songs and google my books.</p>
