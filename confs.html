            <h3>openSUSE 2017</h3>
            <img src="osc17.png" class="img-thumbnail">
            <p> <b>May 26-27 2017 <br /> Nuremberg, Germany</b> <br />
            In 2017 I was accepted in one of openSUSE's GSoC prokects so I went with my mentor and an other mentee at their
            conference. There, I worked as a volunteer and I met some very interesting people who worked at SUSE. My favourite part was the
            pre-conference party at Friday were all of the participants went at a beer place and I drunk red beer (best beer I have ever tasted)
            and I was talking to this really cool and old teacher and everyone was laughing and getting to know eachother. The weather was superwarm
            and I loved the town and I was very happy to be there! Also, we got a private toor at the SUSE hadquorters and their datacenter and
            this was also a very cool experience. </p>

            <h3>Fosdem 2019 & 2020</h3>
            <img src="images/fosdem.png" class="img-thumbnail">
            <p> <b>February 02-03/2019 & 01-02/2020 <br /> Brussels, Belgium</b> <br />
            Fosdem is the biggest opensource conference that is held every year the first weekend of February in Brussels. I once suggested at our IEEE SB meeting
            the idea of attending the conference and some people were intested so we booked a flight and went to Brussels. The conference is (and i can't strees that enough)
            A M A Z I N G ! We met people from all over the world, we went at talks that were way advanced for us, we worked as volunteers, we drunk belgium beers,
            we ate sooo many waffles, walked in the city and I helped my friends with SQL cause it was exams period. Best thing about Fosdem? You can talk to anyone and
            anyone will talk to you. We met people who worked at Firefox, Postgres, VLC etc. We got drunk while drinking beers with some folks from Google. I loved every single
            moment from this trip, both years. Get some friends and go to Fosdem next year.  </p>

            <h3>Rails Girls Athens 2019</h3>
            <img src="images/rails.png" class="img-thumbnail">
            <p> <b>May 10-11 <br /> Athens, Greece</b> <br />
            This is not a conference but a tech event. Rails Girls is a worldwide event were they focus on program langueage Ruby and the framework Rails.
            Me and my friend Elli (aka yiaourti me melli) went to Athens with a couple of more friends. I was a mentor so I had the chance to help a girl I was
            assagned to to learn the basics of Ruby on Rails. It was really fun cause I already knew rails and I was happy that I was able to help someone else
            with my knowledge. We also had the chance to see more of Athens so, once again, we had a great time there.
