      <h5>Here is a list of some rock(-ish) songs you should listen to  . I like introducing new songs to people so here are some songs
      that I very much enjoy, yet you may have not heard before.</h5>

          <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWR1h-5EzUo">The Rat - The Walkmen</a></h3>
          <p>This song was playing on the radio while I was driving to school. For the first time in my life, aaall of the traffic lights were green!
          However, I caught a lyric and googled it later. I jam to this song.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
          <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpRh5bChBSM">Busman's Holiday - Allah-Las</a></h3>
          <p>Another song I listened to 105.5 FM, this time I was driving <i>from</i> school. The traffic gods
          were by my side that day so I "Hey Google, what's this song"ed it. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
          <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCHv9jHHgwU">Slippery People - Talking People</a></h3>
          <p>You know you're in a bad place when you consider Spotify one of your bffs, and how can you not when
          it makes you daily mixes based on your taste in music??! Spotify had this song in one of the rock mixes
           it made for me one time when I was cleaning my room after a mental breakdown (tmi??).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
          <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8wifV5RYr8">Sedona - Houndmouth</a></h3> <br />
          <p>This song gives me a "sing it while you're making pancakes for breakfast with your s.o." kind of vibe. I like its vibe.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
          <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1_IXFQY5Wk">Black Madona - Cage the Elephant</a></h3>
          <p>This song was also in one of my Spotify's daily mixes and I heard it for the first time while I was making this very page.
          It catched my ear and listened to it twice. I think it's a sign from God that I should put it in this list.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWX_MFNOL_Y">Cat People - David Bowie</a></h3><br />
          <p>Okay, okay, I know I promised songs that aren't very popular, but I couldn't resist adding Bowie. Also, if you have
          not heard this song before <i>SHAME ON YOU</i> and you're welcome.</p>

          <h2>Books:</h2>
          <h5>So many books, so little time. And those books definitely worth your time.</h5>
          <br />
          <h3>The Little Prince - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry </h3>
          <blockquote> It is the time wasted for your rose that makes
            your rose so important.
          </blockquote>
          <p class="cont">A children's book for adults. Every time I read this book I discover something new that I had
          not noticed before. Every page is a lesson and the food for thought that this little book provide could satisfy the
            hungriest soul. Every single person on this earth should read it and that's not an opinion, that is a fact.</p>
          <br />
          <h3>The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-time - Mark Haddon </h3>
          <blockquote> And when you look at the sky you know you are looking at stars which are hundreds and thousands of light-years away from you.
              And some of the stars don’t even exist anymore because their light has taken so long to get to us that they
              are already dead, or they have exploded and collapsed into red dwarfs. And that makes you seem very small, and if you
              have difficult things in you life it is nice to think that they are what is called negligible, which means they are so
              small you don’t have to take them into account when you are calculating something.
          </blockquote>
          <p class="cont">Christopher has a photographic memory. He loves maths and science but finds hard to understand other human beings.
          When he finds his neighbour's dog lying dead, he sets out to solve the murder in the style of his favourite (logical) detective, Sherlock Holmes.
          Narrated in the first-person, this book gives a very unique point of view as you see life through the eyes of a teenager with high-functioning autism.
          The perfect book for a birthday present for any age.</p>
          <br />
          <h3>Interesting Times - Terry Pratchett </h3>
          <blockquote> There is a curse. They say: May you live in interesting times.
          </blockquote>
          <p class="cont">Discworld is a flat planet balanced on the backs of four elephants which in turn stand on the back of a giant turtle who floats on the universe.
          Gods, monsters, magicians, ancient spirits -the <i>Discworld</i> series is the perfect choice for any fictional novel fan. In the 17th book of the series, we follow
          Rincewind, a coward wizard with no skill, no wizardly qualifications, and no interest in heroics, who somehow is now responsible to save the world.
          Satirist, humorist and extremely talented Pratchett had me reading this book while holding the dictionary on the other hand. Also, I think this quote describes perfectly the situation
          we are living today. </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Veronika Decides to Die - Paulo Coelho </h3>
          <blockquote> Be like the fountain that overflows, not like the cistern that merely contains.
          </blockquote>
          <p class="cont">Veronika takes some pills to end her life. Then, she wakes up at a mental hospital. There, she will meet new people,
          she will love and laugh and accept herself. The irony is that the moment she falls in love with being alive and all the things in life that are yet to discovered,
          she gets informed that the pills made a great damage to her organs and her time is running out. I read this book in junior high and found brilliant how
          Coelho portraits such an elegant issue as wishing to die. Truly an anthem to life. </p>
